This project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python's tkinter library. 
It is a simple two-player game where players alternate marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, attempting to align three of their marks horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally. The program also detects ties if no winning combinations are possible.

Features:

1. Interactive GUI:
    - A 3x3 grid represented by buttons that players can click to mark their moves.
    - Buttons dynamically update their text to "X" or "O" based on the current player.
2. Two-Player Turn Management:
    - Players take turns, with player X starting the game.
    - The game alternates between players automatically.
3. Win Detection:
    - Checks all possible winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) after each move.
    - Displays a message announcing the winner (Player X or O).
4. Tie Detection:
    - If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game announces a tie.
5. Reusability:
    - Although not implemented in this version, the program can be extended to include a "Reset" button or automated restart.

Core Functionalities

1. Grid Creation:
    - The game board is created using **`Button`** widgets arranged in a grid layout.
2. Event Handling:
    - Button clicks are handled by a single function, which:
        - Updates the button's text based on the current player.
        - Disallows moves on already-marked buttons.
3. Win/Tie Detection:
    - Logic checks all possible winning combinations for both "X" and "O".
    - A flag tracks the number of moves to detect ties.
4. Feedback to Players:
    - Messageboxes inform players of invalid moves, wins, or ties.
